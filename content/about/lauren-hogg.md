Lauren is an EMCC-accredited coach whose work focuses on using coaching to effectively transform leaders, teams and organisations. Her coaching supports leaders to raise awareness of their thoughts and behaviours, allowing them to engage more intentionally with their work. By creating a safe space for individuals to think, explore and reconnect with themselves, she generates clarity and insight, enabling clients to thrive.
