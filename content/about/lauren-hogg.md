# Lauren&nbsp;Hogg&nbsp;|&nbsp;Coach

Lauren is an EMCC-accredited coach whose work focuses on using coaching to effectively support and transform leaders, teams, and organisations.  Her work generates clarity and insight, enabling clients to thrive by creating a safe space for individuals to think, explore and reconnect with themselves. Her coaching enables leaders to become more aware of their thoughts, behaviours, values and strengths, allowing them to engage more intentionally with their role, with themselves and what is important to them in their work and their lives. 

Lauren’s interest in coaching stems from her time as a professional musician, seeing the impact that coaching can have on performance, and her curiosity about how ‘musical teams’ (ensembles) work together. 

In working with you, Lauren will:
1.	Provide a safe space for reflection and reconnection in pursuit of transformational change in beliefs, attitude and behaviour.
2.	Raise awareness and bring insight in service of performance, confidence, belief and what is required to thrive in your context.
3.	Offer support and challenge to pragmatically address the real barriers to change.
4.	Bring clarity and alignment to conversations around purpose, goals, expectations, and ways of working, in order to improve relationships and lead to better team working.
5.	Create space for focused thinking that translates ideas into practical actions and solutions.

**What clients say about Lauren**  
*“Lauren's open and caring coaching style is a breath of fresh air when I need space to think and reflect on where I am and my future goals, and the transition and activity needed to move from one space to another. Lauren reads people very well, and has a knack for asking the right questions at the right time - often flooring me with what comes up when she drops one of her pearls into our conversations. Lauren's warmth, humour, and insight are valuable tools to support anyone on their journey of change.”* - Sarah C
