    comment: Lauren really helped me step up into my role as a leader and move away from the operational. The balance in terms of thinking and practical was just right. I was able to move some priorities forward, as well as noticing the difference in my own behaviours. This has not only been a huge benefit in terms of my own development, but also what I can offer in the role.

    comment: I don’t get surprised by many people but I have been blown away with the strength and power of Lauren’s coaching. Lauren has a calm, unassuming and gentle energy which is a joy to be around - as a coach she challenges me in ways that empower me to grow and expand my thinking but she combines this with a deep empathy for the human condition and working with her is pure gold. Thank you Lauren for being such a brilliant gift in my life!

    comment: I would absolutely recommend the work of Lauren. The results of the last six months and how I am now feeling are testament to Lauren’s work.
