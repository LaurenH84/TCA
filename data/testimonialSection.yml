  - name: Jesse S
    comment: Everyone needs a chance to talk honestly about big things - Lauren is my professional therapist.
  - name: Fahrah G
    comment: I don’t get surprised by many people but I have been blown away with the strength and power of Lauren’s coaching. Lauren has a calm, unassuming and gentle energy which is a joy to be around - as a coach she challenges me in ways that empower me to grow and expand my thinking but she combines this with a deep empathy for the human condition and working with her is pure gold. Thank you Lauren for being such a brilliant gift in my life!

    comment: Lauren's open and caring coaching style is a breath of fresh air when I need space to think and reflect on where I am and my future goals, and the transition and activity needed to move from one space to another. Lauren reads people very well, and has a knack for asking the right questions at the right time - often flooring me with what comes up when she drops one of her pearls into our conversations. Lauren's warmth, humour, and insight are valuable tools to support anyone on their journey of change.

    comment: Lauren really helped me step up into my role as a leader and move away from the operational. The balance in terms of thinking and practical was just right. I was able to move some priorities forward, as well as noticing the difference in my own behaviours. This has not only been a huge benefit in terms of my own development, but also what I can offer in the role.

    comment: I would absolutely recommend the work of Lauren. The results of the last six months and how I am now feeling are testament to Lauren’s work.
